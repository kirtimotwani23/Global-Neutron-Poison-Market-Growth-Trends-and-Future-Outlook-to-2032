Global Neutron Poison Market: Market Segmentation Analysis
In applications such as nuclear reactors, a neutron poison (also called a neutron absorber or a nuclear poison) is a substance with a large neutron absorption cross-section. In such applications, absorbing neutrons is normally an undesirable effect. However, neutron-absorbing materials, also called poisons, are intentionally inserted into some types of reactors in order to lower the high reactivity of their initial fresh fuel load. Some of these poisons deplete as they absorb neutrons during reactor operation, while others remain relatively constant.
The global Neutron Poison market size was estimated at USD 89 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 191.71 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.90% during the forecast period.
North America Neutron Poison market size was estimated at USD 26.86 million in 2023, at a CAGR of 7.63% during the forecast period of 2025 through 2032.
